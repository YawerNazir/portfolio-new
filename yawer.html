<p>Zainab bint Muhammad (Arabic: زَيْنَب بِنْت مُحَمَّد)‎ (598/599–629 CE) was the eldest daughter <br/>of the Islamic prophet Muhammad by his first wife Khadijah.</p>

<h2>Marriage</h2>

<hr/>
<p>She married her maternal cousin, Abu al-As ibn al-Rabi', <br> before December 610,[3]: 313–314 [4]: 21 [5]: 162  and Khadija gave her a wedding present <br> of an onyx necklace.[4]: 22  They had two children, son Ali, who died in <br> childhood, and daughter Umamah, who would bear children, <br> including Hilal or Muhammad al-Awsat.[4]: 21 [5]: 162 [6] <br> Zainab became a Muslim soon after Muhammad first declared <br>himself a prophet. The Quraysh pressured Abu al-As to divorce Zainab,<br> saying they would give him any woman he liked in exchange,<br> but Abu al-As said that he did not want any other woman,<br> a stance for which Muhammad commended him. Muhammad had no jurisdiction <br>over Mecca and therefore could not force them to separate,<br> so they continued to live together despite Abu al-As's refusal to convert to Islam. <br> Zainab remained in Mecca when the other Muslims following Muhammad migrated to Medina.</p>
